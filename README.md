# Latedit

A python library with accompanying CLI programs for editing and
manipulating Latex documents.

The CLI programs show case examples of how to use the python API to 
interact with latex documents.

## Setup

Install using

```
pip3 install .
```

This will ensure that dependencies are downloaded, and all CLI programs
are added to your path. The jinja templates are also created in the
directory `~/.latedit/templates`.

A lot of API functions use environment structures. The configuration file
for the environment structures can be generated using `latex-environment.py`.
